# Data Science Internship - Task 1: Iris Dataset Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
As part of my internship at **DevelopersHub Corporation**, I have completed Task 1, which focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization. The goal of this task is to understand the structure of the Iris dataset and visualize the relationships between different flower features.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data loading and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating statistical visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)**: For writing and executing code.

## 📊 Key Tasks Performed
1. **Data Inspection**: Checked dataset shape, column names, and the first few rows.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Verified that there were no missing values in the dataset.
3. **Statistical Summary**: Analyzed the mean, median, and spread of the features.
4. **Visualizations**:
   - **Scatter Plot**: Analyzed the relationship between Sepal Length and Sepal Width.
   - **Histogram**: Examined the distribution of Petal Length.
   - **Box Plot**: Detected outliers and the spread of Petal Width across species.

## 💡 Insights
- The **Setosa** species is significantly different from **Versicolor** and **Virginica** in terms of petal measurements, making it easily identifiable.
- Petal length shows a clear gap in distribution, indicating distinct clusters within the data.

## 📂 How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in this repository.
2. You can run it directly in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
3. Ensure you have `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib` installed.
